I've made an internet research, which gave me an information, that the first IP address from the traceroute's output is the router's IP. Router, itself is a networking device that forwards data packets between computer networks (local Ethernet and Internet) - which is what we need to find in this ex. Also, router IP is known as the default gateway in the routing table, found in ex05. Howewer, I've doublechecked this addresses and they were different. So I performed "whois" command call on this first traceroute's IP and found out, that this is the IP of our network's internet provider - Ukraine Optical Systems. Taking into account, that our network doesn't have Wi-Fi connections I'm assuming, that 178.214.196.33 (proveder's IP) is the link between my computer and the outside world.
